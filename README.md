# LC3VM

This repository implements the LC3 VM (in C++) as well as an assembler (in Python) to convert LC3 assembly programs into machine code that the VM can understand. To use the assembler, simple use the command `python assembler.py your_file_here.asm` in the Python command line and it will produce `your_file_here-assembled.obj` as output. There are no dependencies beyond the standard library for both the Python and C++ parts of the repository. To run the VM, provide `your-file-here-assembled.obj` as an argument before executing. Once the VM receives the file it will execute it and print any relevant output to the terminal.
